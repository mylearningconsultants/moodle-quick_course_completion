Quick Course Completion - Moodle Local Plugin
===================

Course completion based only on Activity completion and/or Course grade is processed immediately (just as activity completions within a course). Course completions based on any other criteria here, however, are processed in accordance with cron settings as defined in Scheduled tasks.
